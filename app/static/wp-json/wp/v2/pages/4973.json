It is an intermediate staffing solution where a candidate is employed on a temporary basis with an intention to be absorbed permanently after evaluating his\/her skills and capabilities for a specific period. As an employer, you get tremendous flexibility in terms of monitoring work performance of an employee prior to making a formal offer of employment.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nTrinity\u2019s contract-to-hire solutions provide our customers the option of hiring the candidate after an initial amount of time. During the initial engagement, our clients have the opportunity to review the candidate\u2019s core skill level as well as \u2018on-the-job\u2019 interpersonal and presentation skills prior to making a hiring commitment.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why use Contract-to-Hire (Temporary) Staffing?<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>High levels of attrition are major concerns in the employment sector. Contract staffing is the most viable option for companies to manage these forces. You get tremendous flexibility to ramp up or slow down your team size depending upon the project requirements while Bridge Careers Travel Agencies manages the contracts. Bridge Career ensures you get the best talent in your required skill set, who also have hands on experience in their specific career fields.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nBridge Career offers contract\/temporary staff on an hourly bill rate for a set duration of time. This engagement makes you free from all human resource functions including payroll generation and distribution, payroll tax withholding, state and federal reporting requirements and employer related insurance administration.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Direct Hire and why is it beneficial?<\/h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAdding high level candidates to your staff can often be very difficult, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a stressful process. Bridge Careers Travel Agencies has access to top-rated individuals who have an extensive background in very specific fields \u2013 including those hard-to-reach professionals who are not actively searching for a job. And, because we are committed to finding the right professionals for your business, the only candidates you will meet are those who have passed our in-depth screening process.\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nFor individuals who are passive candidates and are not actively seeking employment, we provide a direct hire option for those \u201dhigh level\u201d candidates to recruit them to your organization. Most companies spend a majority of their recruiting resources targeting the 17% who are actively looking, while most passive candidates are open to a discussion with a recruiter. Bridge Career targets the hidden 83% of candidates that are open to new opportunities while providing you with the benefit of seeing nationwide recruiting efforts with those who are otherwise elusive from most companies.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"\/contact\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Contact Us<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hire only proven talent Reduced HR Costs Maintain low turnover Flexibility to ramp up and slow down team size Reduce HR administration Reduce time spent on recruiting Enjoy a \u201cno stress\u201d hiring process Contract-to-hire enables our clients to fill a full-time position after an on-the-job performance evaluation.
