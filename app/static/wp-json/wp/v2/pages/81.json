Jesus taught us that it is better to give than receive and we enjoy watching the fruit of our labor add value and serve those in need. We have created a give-back program that for every job placed, we will donate to the organizations throughout Tulsa.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we are blessed in our business, we want to \u201cpay it forward\u201d. Our charitable support has included domestic shelters, adult transition facilities, residential childcare programs, mental health resources, food banks, local education programs, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage our team to do the following every day:<br><ol>\r\n<li><b>Think of ways to add value to people.<\/b> Every day, think of small (or big) things that Bridge Career can do to help others.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Look for Ways to Add Value to People.<\/b> In addition to thinking ahead about ways to add value, people who live with intentionality are also on constant lookout for spontaneous ways to help others. They have an outward focus as they go through their lives, ready to do something that makes someone\u2019s day. These actions don\u2019t have to be big or expensive; small meaningful actions can make a big difference. The key is to open our eyes and be ready to seize opportunities as they present themselves.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Do Things That Add Value to People.<\/b> As our founder, Cory Minter\u2019s mentor (David Edens) often says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you\u2019re going to do &#8211; show me.\u201d It\u2019s great to think ahead and look around for ways to add value to others, but nothing beats actually doing something for another person. In public or in private, in small ways or large, taking action to add value to someone else is a wonderful expression of the Bridge Career spirit.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Encourage Others to Add Value to People<\/b> &#8211; Significance begins with us, but it\u2019s meant to be shared. As we develop and learn the daily habit of adding value to others, we want to share the spirit of giving by being an encouragement to people close to us to do the same. Our goal is to begin a significant movement right in your own office and community. <\/li><\/ol>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Bridge Career Serves \u201cDo not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.\u201d Hebrews 13:16 At Trinity, we get excited about giving back to the community.
