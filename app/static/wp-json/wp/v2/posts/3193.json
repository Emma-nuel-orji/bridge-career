I&#8217;ve done this for probably about the past 20-years so I&#8217;ve seen some of the very best people interviewed, and I&#8217;ve seen some of the craziest things you&#8217;ll ever, ever see in your life. In fact, I think I should probably write a book about it because some of it got really, really crazy.\n\nI don&#8217;t want to talk about the crazy and I don&#8217;t want to talk about about the exceptional interviews. I want to talk about the people that are kind of in-between that make you go, &#8220;Man, I don&#8217;t know that I trust that person 100%.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to go over three words that people use to describe themselves sometimes in an interview and that I just wouldn&#8217;t recommend. At the same time I want to give you some other alternatives on how you can represent yourself and talk about yourself. I think it&#8217;s going to help you. Let&#8217;s get started.\n\nTulsa Staffing Company\n\nThe first thing that I hear people say regularly about themselves is that they are intelligent. I hear this a lot and I got to be honest with you. When I have somebody tell me that they&#8217;re intelligent and they say it a couple of times, the very first thing that I go to is, if they have to tell me that they&#8217;re intelligent and after being intentional with it, I don&#8217;t know how intelligent they are. It just makes me question whether or not they really are. I want to give you an alternative. Rather than saying that you&#8217;re intelligent, I really think you ought to give some examples of how you improve something by thinking outside of the box.\n\nMaybe give an example of a problem that it was really difficult for the entire team to solve, but you came up with a really good answer for it. So rather than talking about your intelligence, give examples of how you used your intellect to solve problems, maybe save money, and do that in a way that most of the other people on your team weren&#8217;t able to do and it was something that your supervisor really appreciated about you. You can even say it like that, &#8220;You know one thing that I think that my supervisor really appreciated about me was, I was able to think outside of the box on a few situations that we had and it provided a much better solution. Let me give you a couple examples of that.&#8221; That&#8217;s a much better way of saying that you&#8217;re intelligent. I think it&#8217;ll be a whole lot more believable. Definitely give examples. Don&#8217;t go around telling everybody you&#8217;re intelligent.\n\nThe second most watered down term that I hear a lot is, that I&#8217;m so <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thrive15.com\">successful<\/a>. I&#8217;m a people person, I just know how to work with people really well. I think that this is almost like going and telling everybody that you are a beautiful and powerful American. It&#8217;s just &#8230; When you tell people that, it makes them stand back and it makes them question &#8230; There might be a reason why they&#8217;re overcompensating and telling you things like this. Rather than saying that you&#8217;re successful in certain areas, I really think that it&#8217;s just like the intellect part. You really need to give examples of how you&#8217;ve led your team to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makeyourlifeepic.com\">success<\/a>.\n\nThe third thing that I hear from employees interviews all the time, especially mainly on a hourly rate is that I&#8217;m reliable, and they say this over and over again. It&#8217;s just been my experience that the more somebody tells you they are reliable, that they don&#8217;t like drama, that the more that they say these things, the more it tells me they have had issues with this in the past and they&#8217;re wanting to overcompensate for it. If you want to talk about reliability, I know I&#8217;m giving you the same example for all of these, but use examples on how you&#8217;re reliable to your employer. Don&#8217;t just say the word and expect them to 100% believe that that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re talking about. I really think that by giving examples rather than just talking about the terminology, I really think that&#8217;s going to help you a lot.\n\nPay attention to this, study on your interview, you&#8217;ll get better. I promise. Good luck with that.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicphotostulsa.com\">Tulsa<\/a> Staffing Company","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Cory Minter and I&#8217;m president of Bridge Careers Travel Agencies, a Tulsa staffing company and want to talk to you just a couple of minutes about some of the things that I&#8217;ve learned while interviewing people.
