However, if you pay attention to social media and the mainstream media, they will tell you that you need to eat better, exercise and be smarter with your money. Those things tend to be the main things that we are told to focus on. I think that those things are great and I have specific goals regarding those things myself this year. But, I wanted to share with you another way of looking at the year to come.\n\nI spend a good deal of time studying successful businesses as well as the habits of people who have seen an extraordinary amount of success in their life. When studying these businesses and successful people, it is easy to see that most of them do the same things over and over. I though, why not consider applying some of these principles? For this article, I would like to start with Napoleon Hill in his book \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d. I highly recommend this book for business and personal growth, but for the next few minutes, I would like for you to consider applying the advice for this next year in your current job and just see what it does to your career.\n\nQuote 1 &#8211; Napoleon Hill &#8211; \u201cThe starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this consistently in mind. Weak Desire brings weak results. Just a small fire makes a small amount of heat.\u201d\n\nTo do well in almost anything, you have to have some level of desire. Those that I know the best that are very successful, all have an intentional focus on what they want to be good at. It starts with a desire and that desire becomes a goal and the goal is not ignored. You can almost go to the gym and see about when most people give up on their new year\u2019s goals. It is right over a month. Here is what happens; they had the desire to start, but they did not have the diligence to follow through. The reason that many people are unable to fulfill their desires is not a desire problem, it is a diligence problem. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be a part of the majority of Americans who will not fulfill their goals this year. Commit to turning your desires into to success through diligence.\n\nQuote 2 &#8211; Napoleon Hill &#8211; You are the master of your destiny. You can influence, direct and control your own environment. You can make your life what you want it to be.\u201d\n\nConsider what you are listening to, watching or reading. Who are you around? What kind of overall environment are you allowing yourself to be in? What you put in is what eventually comes out. IF you put good in, you get good out. IF you put bad in, bad comes out. What are you doing to learn more and invest into your goals? Success is not going to just come and land in your lap. If you want earn more in your job, what are you doing to add value to your employer? If you want to climb a mountain, what are you doing to learn about mountain climbing? Remember, It starts with YOU and YOU can control this. But you have to be intentional and DILIGENT.\n\nI hope that this small article along with the advice of Napoleon Hill helps you throughout this new year. I wish you the best! Be diligent.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a staffing specialist in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas, I am one of those people that have a true desire to improve myself every year.
