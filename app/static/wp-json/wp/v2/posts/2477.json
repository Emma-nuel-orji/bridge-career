Maybe they have the background, and maybe they have the intellect and knowledge, but they are just plain weird.\u00a0 Or maybe your team is the one that is weird.\u00a0 Either way, they are not a fit.\u00a0 Rule number one is to not hire someone that you do not believe would be an easy personality fit for your team.\u00a0 I see small businesses do this regularly.\n\n<strong>Take your time and be picky for the right things<\/strong>:\u00a0 Millions of dollars every year are saved by the company that decides to take its time when hiring their new addition to the team.\u00a0 Many novice hiring manager are often tempted to hire the first person that they just plain \u201cliked\u201d.\u00a0 There are a couple of things that I would like to bring up that I unfortunately have some experience with.\u00a0 People that are naturally likable, very friendly and have the ability to be very warm, fun and enjoyable in the interview have a tendency to be very dramatic when the test of time is come and gone.\u00a0 I want to encourage you to be conscious of this type of person.\u00a0 Usually they walk in and everyone likes them immediately.\u00a0 They are usually funny, fun to talk with and everyone just has the \u201cfeeling\u201d that they would be fun to be with every day.\u00a0 In my experience, some of these kinds of people can be VERY friendly, VERY opinionated and sometimes VERY dramatic.\u00a0 Checking references would be HIGHLY recommended for someone that you immediately like for those reasons and want to hire.\n\nObviously there are many things to consider when bringing on your next team member, but being picky and taking your time are two of the most important things to remember.\u00a0 Especially if you find someone like I described that is just instantly likeable.\u00a0 It is sometimes forgotten by some managers at how much money is actually lost when they make a decision to hire someone that does not work out.\u00a0 It is so important that your staff, who are responsible for hiring, be reminded of the average cost of an employee that does not work out.\u00a0 Every company\u2019s human resources are either their biggest asset or liability.\u00a0 Good or Bad employees can make or break any company.\u00a0 Be very careful to not cost your company the hefty price of a mis-hire this year.\n\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hiring Employees in Tulsa, OK Bridge Careers Travel Agencies &nbsp; Hiring employees in today\u2019s market is becoming more and more difficult.\u00a0 There are many things that contribute as key reasons for this.\u00a0 Even though it is a known problem, it is still the recruiter\u2019s responsibility to overcome these obstacles and deliver positive results to their companies.\u00a0 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[120],"tags":[916,917,918,60,919,920,19,11],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.9 -
