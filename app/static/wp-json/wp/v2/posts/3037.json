Honest&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"Being Honest Saves Everyone So Much Time\n\nI was in a meeting with a group of individuals who were all very successful people and we were tasked with completing a pretty large project and were given a goal to complete the project.\u00a0 The only thing discussed that first day was that it would be great if we could get this done and everyone seemed to just talk about how great it will be to complete this project.\u00a0 So we all went off and when we came back to the next meeting, no one had really done anything.\u00a0 Keep in mind this is a group of high producers.\u00a0 This went on for several months until someone on the leadership team had expressed their disgust with the lack of progress and demanded specific tasks that needed to be accomplished and introduced metrics that would accomplish the goal.\u00a0 The next month, everyone had met their goal and we were well on our way to completing the task.\u00a0 Does the first part of this story sound like any of the meetings that you have ever been in?\n\nA key component of success is having the ability to communicate ideas to others and motivate them to attainment.\u00a0 However, a great part of that communication skill that often sets everyone up for success is having the ability to be frank and honest in their feedback.\u00a0 Rather it be good or bad.\u00a0 That is something that is missing in many companies today and there are several reasons for it.\u00a0 However, it is something that can elevate any group; just having the ability to be honest with each other.\u00a0 Let me explain why.\n\nWe live in a society that relies and prefers for those around them to sugar coat everything.\u00a0 When a message is sugar coated there are some key components that are missed because the message was not clearly relayed.\u00a0 For example:\u00a0 A manager may not be happy with an employee\u2019s performance and might communicate the message like this:\u00a0 \u201cYou are doing a good job, but we would like to see you to become the best that you can be.\u00a0 Can you try to work harder at completing your project on time?\u00a0 It would really help the team.\u201d\u00a0 It would be easy for the employee to not see their performance to be something that is a concern with this kind of message.\u00a0 However, if you communicated the message like this:\u00a0 \u201cYour performance is not meeting our standards.\u00a0 When a deadline is set for projects to be completed, we expect for you to meet those deadlines.\u00a0 If you are unable to meet them, it will be a problem for everyone involved.\u201d\u00a0 This message creates a clear problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nIt is imperative that managers are clear and concise with employees.\u00a0 If there is an expectation that needs to be met, it is essential that the manager be clear if there is a deadline or if there are any metrics that need to be met.\u00a0 If the manager is not specifically clear on what they want from someone, it often leads to a misunderstanding and the employee \u201cassumes\u201d what the manager needs for them to accomplish and when they need to accomplish it.\n\nMany managers are uncomfortable addressing employees with honesty and with specific details.\u00a0 Any good manager understands the uncomfortable situation of telling someone that they need to improve on this or that.\u00a0 It is never fun to have those conversations.\u00a0 However, by not having them, there is more of a disservice to the employee by not communicating clearly what expectations are.\u00a0 It can leave them confused and the manager frustrated because desired results are not being met.\u00a0 This kind of miscommunication can be eliminated with a simple clear and honest conversation about where they stand.\u00a0 It is only fair to let them know.\u00a0 If they have a desire to successfully work with you, they will make efforts for adjustment.\u00a0 One of my mentors once told me that to not correct bad behavior or work performance is basically the equivalent of celebrating it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s be honest.\u00a0 It will help everyone out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being Honest Saves Everyone So Much Time I was in a meeting with a group of individuals who were all very successful people and
