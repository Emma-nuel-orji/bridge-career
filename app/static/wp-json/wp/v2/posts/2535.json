especially when you are frustrated with the individual.\u00a0 However, if you can prepare yourself to BE PATIENT, you will likely thank yourself later and it will most likely lead to a much more positive result for both you and the person you are coaching.\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/12\/the-questions-good-coaches-ask\">Harvard Business Review article<\/a> \u201cThe Questions Good Coaches Ask\u201d, the right questions can stop someone in their tracks as they finally see their own actions from a different perspective or when they can envision a new solution to an old problem.\u00a0 Sometimes people need to learn to question themselves so that the next time they can catch themselves in the act and change their actions in the moment.\u00a0 It is very important for many people to learn on their own rather than take someone\u2019s word for it.\u00a0 Some of the best managers learn this lesson and apply it each day.\u00a0 And according to many studies done on managing.\u00a0 It is well backed that this old coaching tip is one well worth perfecting.\u00a0 I hope that you and your staff can benefit from this small piece of advice.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was invited to an event not long ago that honored a hall of fame college basketball coach Eddie Sutton.\u00a0 It was a great event where many of his players from the past showed up to not only honor him, but also share stories that were funny learning lessons as well as serious ways in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[120],"tags":[963,964,921,965,966,242,967,920,968,19,9,209,969,935,970],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Better the Employment Manager | Tulsa staffing<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"I was invited to an event not long ago that honored a hall of fame college basketball coach Eddie Sutton.
