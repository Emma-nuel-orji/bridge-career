Those that have the ability to disregard hurdles and setbacks and keep their eyes on the main goal have a great advantage.\u00a0 It will seem to others to be a super-hero type strength that leads them consistently to success.\u00a0 Many will just think that they are lucky, but the very successful will know that it is because of this mindset.\u00a0 This viewpoint is not only healthy, but also offers some the fortitude to continue marching forward regardless of the circumstances.\u00a0 Movies are made about people who have the ability to maintain this thought process through storms and obstacles.\u00a0 It is repeated throughout history enough times that it is a certainty that this kind of thinking can lead to unimagined success.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nThese are a few of the patterns that I have noticed from my mentors and by reading about others who have seen a great deal of success.\u00a0\u00a0 These concepts are hard to maintain, but I hope that they inspire and encourage you to adopt these yourself.\u00a0 These offer a healthy mentality that will get anyone going in the right direction.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Staying motivated can be very difficult to do.\u00a0 Especially in difficult times.\u00a0 So how do some of the most successful people stay motivated when going through difficulties?\u00a0 This is something that I have studied over the past two or three years and I have listened and read many books that cover this topic.\u00a0 Because, tough [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[120],"tags":[1085,1193,1094,917,1101,1097,918,60,19,184,950],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Traits of the Highly Successful | Tulsa Staffing<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Staying motivated can be very difficult to do.
