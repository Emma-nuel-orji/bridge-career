I can\u2019t help but think of how influential of a person she has become.\u00a0 Just think if you had the ability to post one message online and be all but guaranteed that at least 1,000,000 people would view that comment, opinion, or request.\u00a0 Think of the response you may get.\u00a0 It has the potential to change National opinion.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.harvard.edu\">large institutions<\/a> such as the US government is now somewhat interested in what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mtv.com\">Lady Gaga<\/a> might say about them or anything else, as well as other large businesses.\n\nBusinesses are also racing to get into the social networking game to market and advertize their businesses\/services and become more of a powerful presence in the online world.\u00a0 The reason that they are doing this is because they see the enormous potential of networking with everyone that is surfing the web.\u00a0 They understand the opportunity that comes with having a level of influence regarding their products to you and I and everyone else that may notice them online.\u00a0 Just like anyone who has started a business, whether it is large or small, they know the amount of networking that was required to get it off of the ground, grow, and sustain consistent customers\n\nHave you thought about your personal network?\u00a0 Is it working for you?\u00a0 You can begin building your network by doing these 3 main things:\n\n<strong>1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Get out and meet people in person <\/strong>\n\nThis is a sort of old school networking, but trust me it works.\u00a0 Building relationships a very powerful tool when getting business, or getting hired.\u00a0 People hire and do business with other people that they like, or know someone else that likes them.\u00a0 You need to make sure that you fall into one of these categories.\u00a0 So how do you begin to build your network?\u00a0 <strong>Find organizations<\/strong> that are created for your career field and attend them.\u00a0 While you are there, do your best to meet people.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be frustrated or discouraged if at first you have trouble making connections.\u00a0 Keep going back.\u00a0 Others will begin to remember your face and be more comfortable approaching you.\u00a0 Also, it makes it much easier to approach someone else by saying \u201cI have been meaning to come and meet you.\u00a0 I have seen you at these meetings the past few months\u201d\u00a0 Make your face known to a specific career related field\n\n<strong>2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>\u00a0Get on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\">Facebook<\/a>, Linkedin\u00a0 and Twitter<\/strong>\n\nThis is the biggest thing going right now. \u00a0It is by far the quickest and easiest way to build a network of people.\u00a0 All you need to do is make contact with at least 1 person you know online and then you can start to view the other people they are networked with.\u00a0 It is a great tool for those who are not naturally outgoing.\u00a0 It is a great tool to build a network of people and make that first approach in person much much easier.\n\n<strong>3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Do not let your network work against you<\/strong>\n\nIf you burn bridges or have done so in the past, networking can work against you harder than you would ever believe.\u00a0 It is the one thing that we use as recruiters to check on potential employees.\u00a0 To ask others if they know who you are.\u00a0 For example.\u00a0 If you worked at Hospital X (for example) and we happen to be networked with someone in Hospital X, of course, we will call and ask if they knew you and\/or the quality of your work.\u00a0 Even in large cities, it is fascinating how small of a world it is being that everyone is so well networked in today\u2019s time.\u00a0 Have you ever wondered why it is so important to give a two week notice.\u00a0 If you did not, I\u2019ll bet your past employer was not particularly happy with the way that you left them.\u00a0 Be careful to not ruin your reputation around town.\u00a0 You never know how it may come back to you in the future.\u00a0 Make sure and protect your reputation in your city.\u00a0 It is smaller than you might think.\u00a0 I can guarantee you.\n\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is your networking working? **Find jobs in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Tulsa Staffing Solutions at Bridge Careers Travel Agencies.
