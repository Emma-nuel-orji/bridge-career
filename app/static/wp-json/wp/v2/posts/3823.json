Bridge Career is a staffing company, we specialize in staffing, primarily in the medical field. It\u2019s something that we&#8217;ve done for years, it\u2019s something that we&#8217;re known for. Every major hospital, every major clinic in town knows who Bridge Careers Travel Agencies is because of the quality at how we do our job. We are a company that really focuses on making sure to put quality over quantity. It&#8217;s really important to us. We have a system that we call the A player matchmaker game and the idea behind it is we have taken so many clinics and hospital departments, and they had a really poor morale in their department, they just had a lot of turnover and we asked them this question, &#8220;Would you please follow us with this one suggestion: do not tolerate B and C level players from Trinity, and if we ever send you someone, please terminate them, they may be an A player somewhere else and maybe not in your company, but help us to make sure and only get you A players.&#8221;\n\nThere are three main characteristics about A players that make a really big deal and that is one, A players stay longer, the cost in someone once you get them trained staying longer, you cannot even count the cost because it&#8217;s so valuable. The second thing is, A players attract other A players. I know it sounds crazy but Bridge Career does &#8212; the companies that we&#8217;ve helped the most, they do not need Bridge Career nearly as often as they once did because their A players attract other A players and so they can grow their team organically. The third thing about A players that makes such a big difference and that is, A players do roughly one and a half times the work of your B and C level players. And so, when you slowly and organically grow a company or grow a department, to have only A and high B level players it changes the entire department, the turnover rate reduces to almost nothing, your recruiting costs are almost nothing because A players bring you other A players. It&#8217;s just a complete different dynamic that goes on when the companies have allowed Bridge Career to do this.\n\nSo, one of the main positions that we have to recruit for regularly is we are always recruiting for medical assistants and LPNs, and RNs for that matter. One of the main positions I want to talk about is the MAs that we are constantly staffing for. And MA, for those of you that don&#8217;t know what it does, it&#8217;s a medical assistant, and a medical assistant is responsible for rooming the patient. Once you go to the doctor&#8217;s office and you get to the back, the medical assistant is the person that meets you in the room, documents your chief complaint, now because of Obamacare or, I&#8217;m sorry, The Affordable Care Act, they have to ask you all sorts of questions and you better answer some of those questions right or they&#8217;ll ding you on your insurance, but they&#8217;ll ask you a lot of questions, be putting a lot of information into the computer, the role of a medical assistant has actually changed a lot in the last two years.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nBut the reason that there&#8217;s such a shortage of good medical assistants is because The Affordable Care Act has made it mandatory that medical assistants become certified or registered. The only real thing, once they take a test, the only thing that keeps a medical assistant registered or certified is whether they pay the money to play. It&#8217;s really the weirdest thing ever but it&#8217;s the truth and if they are not registered or certified, the medical clinic, they are unable to bill for the things that they put into the EMR system. You have to have a certified or registered medical assistant to be able to put information into the EMR process.\n\nWhat that&#8217;s created is, there are a lot of medical assistants that have been medical assistants for 10, 15 years and they have more experience than anyone else but they&#8217;re not registered or certified, the only way they can go and become registered or certified is if they go to a class that takes about a year, for them to train them on how to be a medical assistant but the thing is they&#8217;ve been a medical assistant for the last 10 years so in their mind it&#8217;s a complete waste of time and so it has put a lot of medical assistants out of the market and we are able to hire brand new, no experience medical assistants way easier than we could bring in somebody with five years of experience, it&#8217;s a weird thing.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nBut, there&#8217;s been a big shortage for medical assistants. There&#8217;s also been a big shortage for LPNs in the medical world, and the reason is because about eight or nine years ago, the hospitals decided that they did not want to utilize LPNs any longer, they only wanted to utilize RNs. And this was almost nationwide, it was a decision that one of the top hospitals made and everybody followed suit. So what happened there is the schools took notice of that and they stopped training LPNs as much. They wouldn&#8217;t &#8212; they stopped marketing for the program. And so, it\u2019s created a huge decline in the number of certified LPNs and medical assistants that were out there.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nSo now we are constantly recruiting for these positions and we&#8217;re always trying to find someone who has quality and finding someone with quality is really difficult to do because they have so many opportunities presented to them that a lot of times LPNs and medical assistants have a shorter work history and one of the things that Bridge Career wants to try to provide our clients in trying to look at quality over quantity is we want to be able to provide good, solid work history. We don&#8217;t really want to find the people that have a one year here, two years there, one year here, we want to find somebody who stays somewhere for at least four or five years. It&#8217;s a key indicator on an A player and that&#8217;s something that we are constantly looking for.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nSo, if you know of someone, or if you are a medical assistant or an LPN and you have a good work history, and you know yourself to be a good employee, Bridge Career really wants to talk with you. If you are referring someone, please let us know, we have a referral program where we pay $100 to anyone who refers someone over to us and we place them, and they stay for a period of 90 days. We would love to be able to speak with you about either who you know or if you&#8217;re interested in a position. It&#8217;s what we do, we place extraordinary people in extraordinary companies. If you&#8217;re looking for a staffing company that has great companies that we work with, Bridge Career is not a staffing company that works for just anyone. I personally fire companies that do not treat employees well, do not follow the law, we&#8217;re not all things to all people, we want to provide quality, not only for our customers but also for the employees that we work with. We want to be able to refer them to high quality places to work at.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nAnd so, listen, we would love to talk to you. Please contact us. You can go visit us online where we have a list of all of our job positions and everything up there. It&#8217;s online at trinityemployment.com or you can call us at +9186222588. Thank you so much.
