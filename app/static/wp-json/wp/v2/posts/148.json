I was a teacher but\u00a0I was looking for something different. When I was searching for a new job I found Bridge Career. Bridge Career helped me\u00a0find something I really enjoy and something that I didn\u2019t even know I liked doing! They helped me find something that I love and that I&#8217;m\u00a0excited about doing. The best thing about my job is that I am able to help people. Everyday I get to help someone\u2019s life be easier and I think that\u2019s the best thing about my new job. I would defiantly recommend Trinity, I actually have recommended Bridge Career to few people who were looking for jobs. I think that the consistency that Bridge Career offers is one of the best things about them. They make sure that they work as hard for you as you work for them. Being able to come and know that no matter what happens, Bridge Career always has my back, and their always going to support me and make sure that they put me in a position where I will be successful. That is why I would recommend Bridge Career to anyone who is looking for a job.&#8221; \u2013 Matthew Crockett\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Justin, CEO of a Large Orthopaedic Clinic in Tulsa<\/span><\/h2>\n&#8220;Through Bridge Careers Travel Agencies, Cory Minter has been providing staffing services for our client\u00a0for over four years.

I came in and interviewed with Jenny. I had used Bridge Career to hire my own employees in the past and when Jenny called me I knew that I was in good hands. Bridge Career helped me by finding out all about me, my skills and everything that I was wanting to do. They were able to find jobs that I would fit well in and benefit from. What I liked most about my job is interacting with the patients. I\u2019ve been in medical for 15 years and now I\u2019m learning a whole new specialty that I knew nothing about and its exciting to challenge myself! I would defiantly recommend Bridge Career to a family member or friend due to the fact that they really do care about the people who come to them for help in finding a job. They stay with you and help you find the right job that is a great fit for you!&#8221;\u2013 Sara Gaston\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Vicki Bradley<\/span><\/h2>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mGHfUPFnxlU?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n&#8220;My name is Vicki and I work as a medical billing specialist.
