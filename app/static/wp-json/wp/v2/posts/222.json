Bridge Career was started because of many experiences using staffing companies. Its founder (Cory Minter) had to use staffing companies often in previous positions that he had held. Throughout that time, he noticed that the staffing companies that he used did not seem to pay specific attention to very important instructions that were given in the job description, therefore creating a large gap in between what he was looking for and what was being provided as \u201cgood candidates\u201d. Because of the headache that this caused everyone in the organization, he knew that it would be so refreshing if someone were to focus on the specific details given and only send those individuals that truly obtained those skills. Previously, he would receive a wide array of candidates for a very specific job description and it created much more work that he was paying the staffing company to do for him.\n\nWhen Cory started out his career right after college, he worked for a local staffing company and was treated as if he were more as a number rather than a person with much to offer. Because of this experience, it is very important to everyone at Bridge Career to treat those that we work with as we would like to be treated ourselves. Bridge Career wants all its employees to know that they are important. By doing this, employees seem to do a better job while they are at work. Trinity\u2019s retention rate is exceptionally high not only because employees are treated well, but that it does everything possible to reduce the margin of error when selecting the right person for the right position. Trinity\u2019s staff has learned early on that just because someone looks great on paper does not mean that they are the right fit for the position. Bridge Career finds it exceptionally important to pay close attention to the personality fit with in an office as well. This not only serves the employee well, but also many employers throughout Tulsa.\n\nThroughout its lifetime, Bridge Career has grown exponentially, doubling in size each year of its existence. By following the general principles of paying close attention to detail regarding specifics of each position that it recruits for, treating others as we would like to be treated ourselves and by providing exceptional customer service, Bridge Career has made quite a name for itself over the years. Now, a large portion of its business comes from customer and employee referrals.\n\nWhen you treat a customer well, they may tell 2 to 3 people if you are lucky. But if you do a poor job for them, it is common for them to tell as many as 20 to 100 depending on how bad the situation was. Trinity\u2019s growth has come from repeatedly doing a good job for customers over and over again and giving them an incentive to sharing their story and good experience with one customer at a time. This has been a significant differentiator between Bridge Career and other staffing companies in town. In addition to simply doing a good job, Bridge Career also commits itself on always doing the right thing even when it could cost us money. Integrity and character are at the center of the decision-making processes daily.\n\nCory has a true heart for the unemployed and this helps Bridge Career to continue to go beyond what your average staffing organization would do to assist candidates. Bridge Career believes that it is one thing to interview someone and systematically decide potential matches and send resumes accordingly to various opportunities. But Bridge Career believes that is not all staffing companies should focus on. Making money is great and all companies have to make money or they will go out of business. But we at Bridge Career make it a part of our mission to truly look out for each employee and find the right place for them. We understand that God has a place for everyone and it is not always through our company. We are happy when it is, but we really try to focus on helping each individual in giving them advice that truly helps them even when it requires our staff to help them find a job that may not be within our contracted job orders and outside of our company. It may sound an unorthodox way of doing business, but we believe that by helping others out for no other reason will come back as a treasure later down the road. We love the advice that was popularized by Zig Ziglar: \u201cIf you help enough people get what they want, you will have no problem getting what you want\u201d. Something that the Bridge Career team is especially proud of is that if you go to our google reviews and read what our employees say about our staff and how they are treated while they are here, you will notice some fantastic things that we are doing for the individuals that we meet with.\n\nIf you are reading this far, we are grateful for you visiting our website. We hope and pray that we can assist you in a potentially positive way. We would like to invite you to review our current job openings under the career center tab and see if you notice a position that piques your interest. If so, please kindly apply for the position by submitting your resume to us online and feel free to contact us via telephone to confirm that we are in receipt and have your correct contact information.\n\nAll of us at Bridge Career are excited about the accomplishments over the past few years. We look forward to serving Tulsa for many years to come. We encourage any business or potential employee to look at what we have to offer and give us a call. We would love to visit with you about how Bridge Career can serve you.\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/AJc8M5QV814?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>** Learn about Tulsa staffing company, Bridge Careers Travel Agencies Bridge Careers Travel Agencies is a specialized recruiting firm that focuses on collaborating with companies of integrity and offering Human Resources and recruiting services.
