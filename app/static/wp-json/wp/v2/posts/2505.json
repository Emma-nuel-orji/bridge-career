Way to Quit your Job"},"content":{"rendered":"As a staffing company in Tulsa, we obviously deal quite often with individuals who are leaving their jobs.\u00a0 We have seen very many acceptable and also \u201ccolorful\u201d ways in which people have elected to depart from their previous positions.\u00a0 It is always our recommendation to treat their previous boss the way that they would want to be treated and to consider the position that they may put them in with a rapid departure.\u00a0 However, even after our advice, there are many who just choose to leave with no notice and I have no doubt that they will eventually regret that decision.\u00a0 I have some thoughts that I would like to share with you on things to consider if you are ever faced with the decision to leave your place of employment for another career opportunity.\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/\">Harvard Business Review<\/a>, in their article titled <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/12\/how-to-quit-your-job-without-burning-bridges\">\u201cHow to Quit your Job Without Burning Bridges\u201d<\/a>, the average employee stays at their position for approximately 4.6 years.\u00a0 Because people are so used to employees leaving their positions so often, there is usually not going to be an automatic negative reaction to someone leaving for another career opportunity.\u00a0 However, it is always a good rule of thumb for anyone to remember that the way that you begin and end your position is probably going to be what others remember.\u00a0 If you make the decision to leave on a \u201ccolorful\u201d note, there is probably someone within that company that you may run into at some point in the future that will be a decision maker regarding your career.\u00a0 It is important to consider this if you are going to be parting from your current position.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, it is recommended that you leave at least a two week notice, anything less than that is generally considered \u201cbad taste\u201d to most people.\u00a0 Even though this is a general thought, you may want to consider offering more notice to your employer.\u00a0 By offering this, you are letting everyone in the current company know that you are not leaving on bad terms and you are a very considerate person.\u00a0 Also, by offering this, you will let your new employer know something very important about your character.\u00a0 It will help you to get off to a great start.\n\nYou might be thinking\u2026\u2026Why would I leave more notice?\u00a0 I think that most people do not think of the impact that they might have on their employer\u2019s business with their absence.\u00a0 Of course the more significant the role that each position plays can change the impact on the company.\u00a0 So if you play a significant role in your existing company, your absence is not easily replaced.\u00a0 You may leave not only your boss in a bad place, but also everyone around you scrambling to pick up the pieces.\u00a0 Let\u2019s face it, it is almost impossible to replace someone that requires a significant skill set in two weeks.\u00a0 The hardship on a company losing one of their most valuable players is significant.\n\nSome general things to consider are:\u00a0 Tell your boss first, be transparent (with LinkedIn everyone will eventually know where you are going), don\u2019t gossip, be strategic with your timing and show gratitude.\u00a0 These are just some simple things to consider when going through this process.\u00a0 It is always good to remember to just do the right thing as so many people just eliminate this from their thinking.\u00a0 If you do, it will be a mistake.\u00a0 Show good character and be the person that you would WANT to be remembered by and not embarrassed by.\u00a0 Good luck to your in your career!","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a staffing company in Tulsa, we obviously deal quite often with individuals who are leaving their jobs.\u00a0 We have seen very many acceptable and also \u201ccolorful\u201d ways in which people have elected to depart from their previous positions.\u00a0 It is always our recommendation to treat their previous boss the way that they would want [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[120],"tags":[921,951,952,74,953,954,915,920,696],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The &quot;Right&quot;
