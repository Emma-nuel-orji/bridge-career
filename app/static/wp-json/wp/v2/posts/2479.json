Employees in the New Generation"},"content":{"rendered":"Hiring Employees in the New Generation\n\nBridge Careers Travel Agencies, Tulsa, OK\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the last few months, my heart has gone out to new graduates who are trying to get their foot in the door to start their careers in their selected career fields.\u00a0 There are a number of reasons for this that I think may help those who are trying to get their careers moving.\u00a0 There are 2 main things that are growing as key roadblocks to those who have little to no experience.\u00a0 The first is the obvious, which is lack of experience.\u00a0 And the second is the perception that many employers have mostly new grads (otherwise known as Generation Y).\u00a0 Hopefully, I can add some light on these topics for those who are dealing with situations like this in their career search.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Lack of experience:\u00a0 <\/strong>I just got off of the phone with one of our potential candidates that is very eager to work and I am somewhat comfortable that she would be a hard worker.\u00a0 However, she just has no experience under her belt.\u00a0 And as a result, she is hearing the words \u201cyou have no experience\u201d often and is becoming very frustrated with it.\u00a0 I wanted to offer some encouragement and some assistance to her while she is in the midst of her search.\u00a0 First, I encouraged her to just simply do more than anyone else in her situation would.\u00a0 Which would hopefully help her to stand out to employers.\u00a0 What I meant by that was to contact businesses that are in her field by a cold call and ask to introduce herself to the HR manager or recruiter for the position that she would like to apply for.\u00a0 I recommended that she first introduce herself, and if they were not interested in her to volunteer to be an intern at no cost to them.\u00a0 My thinking here is that they would see the potential and the drive that is unusual within the general perceptions of Generation Y.\u00a0 Those who are diligent and relentless in their job search will eventually find someone that sees that drive.\u00a0 As an employer, trust me, it is rare and when you find that drive and commitment, you better hold on to it.\n\n<strong>Generation Y:\u00a0 <\/strong>I highly recommend to new grads to read, understand and know the perceptions that are being talked about by almost every HR professional in the United States right now about Generation Y.\u00a0 I was in a meeting with one of our larger clients yesterday speaking to their director of HR.\u00a0 He specifically told us that he did not want anyone that was a new grad.\u00a0 He told us that they ultimately needed someone with at least 5 years of experience, but he then began to describe his experience with those that he has hired from the Generation Y.\u00a0 He described them as a tea cup; someone who appears competent, however, requires a lot of hand holding and you have to treat them very delicately.\u00a0 He then began to tell a story about one of his existing employees who he claimed to be \u201cvery intelligent\u201d who seemed to have to be supervised on literally everything that she did, even though he continually reminded and encouraged her that she was very capable of understanding the concepts, however never took the time to do that.\u00a0 She immediately needed his help and guidance rather than seeking an answer herself.\u00a0 You could see that he was very disappointed and frustrated seeing so much talent and intellect that just would not go and do anything without his approval.\n\nThe problem that new job seekers are seeing now is that there are many articles written in every newspaper around the nation.\u00a0 I have seen articles in the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\">www.wsj.com<\/a>, USA today <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\">www.usatoday.com<\/a>, The New York Times <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\">www.nytimes.com<\/a>.\u00a0 Even the Harvard Journal wrote a very interesting article about how to hire in the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century (<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/06\/21st-century-talent-spotting\">https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/06\/21st-century-talent-spotting<\/a>).\u00a0 And there are many other newspapers that print articles every week on this subject.\n\nI think that it would be very beneficial for those that are breaking into their career fields at this point in time to know and understand the main concerns that employers have and to address them when they have the opportunity to have an interview.\u00a0 One thing that I think would make our customers feel much more comfortable when hiring someone that is fresh out of school is to hear some of their concerns addressed.\u00a0 By bringing up the \u201celephant in the room\u201d and saying that \u201cI know that there are many perceptions about hiring new grads and I want you to know that I do not fall into the many pitfalls that some of my colleagues are known for and tell them how YOU are different.\u00a0 This will let the employer know that you are aware of the main concerns and that you are cognitively going to make an attempt to not display the undesirable behaviors that are being talked about throughout the nation\u2019s HR departments.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hiring Employees in the New Generation Bridge Careers Travel Agencies, Tulsa, OK &nbsp; In the last few months, my heart has gone out to new
