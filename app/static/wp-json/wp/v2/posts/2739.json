Dating back to the 1500\u2019s Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616) had the following quote \u201cTell me thy company, and I&#8217;ll tell thee what thou art\u201d.\u00a0-.\u00a0 In other words, show me who you are hanging out with and that will tell me who you are and what you will become; with a scary amount of certainty.\n\nThe best thing that I have done is just spend a considerable amount of time studying successful people.\u00a0 As you do this, like I said earlier, you will notice that they all have a history of the same behavioral habits.\u00a0 I would also recommend that you spend time doing what you can to take someone successful to lunch or breakfast and be intentional with your time with them.\u00a0 \u00a0Don\u2019t be embarrassed if you are turned down.\u00a0 It will happen, but eventually if you do not give up, you will be able to put yourself around some very successful people and be on your way to learning how to be successful as well.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time Management and its Relationship to Success I have had the opportunity to be around very successful people over the last couple of years and I do everything that I can to learn from them about what has contributed to their success.\u00a0 One thing that I have learned is that each of these guys does [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[120],"tags":[1096,1186,242,1094,918,1187,696,11],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.9 -
