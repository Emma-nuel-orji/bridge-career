It\u2019s less stressful.\u201d\n\nAnd while you may think planning is a drag, the truth is that the more you plan your life, the more you reduce your stress and increase your sense of control.\n\n<b>Make a choice to be happy:<\/b>\n\nBeing happy sometimes is just a choice.\u00a0 Not only myself, but many people that I know who decide to be happy throughout a week report a dramatic difference in how they felt that their work week went.\u00a0 I remember there was a book written a while back that seemed to make a lot of sense to those who read it.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t Sweat the Small Stuff\u201d\u00a0 Throughout this next week.\u00a0 I want to encourage you to not sweat the small things that all too often make us have a negative opinion of our day.\n\n<b>Plan your commute:\u00a0 <\/b>\n\nRight now, there are lots of construction projects.\u00a0 Make sure and pay attention to that guy on the radio that constantly reminds us that there will be construction here or there.\u00a0 The local news websites also have construction updates updated for you to know when and where the construction will be happening throughout the week.\u00a0 Even though your supervisor may be sympathetic to construction.\u00a0 It is still an unnecessary event that usually rises your stress level.\u00a0 If you plan ahead, you can avoid a big early morning headache.\n\n<b>Try to go out of your way to help someone at work:<\/b>\n\nOne of the most overlooked way to feel more positive is just as simple as lending a helping hand.\u00a0 There is nothing that makes us \u201chuman beings\u201d to feel better than just helping someone out when they don\u2019t expect it.\u00a0 I was at the convenience store the other day and someone was a quarter short and I dug in my pocket and gave them my quarter.\u00a0 They were completely shocked (you could see it in the look on their face)\u00a0 and also, the clerk made a comment thanking me.\u00a0 But I left that convenient store thinking and feeling great about what I had done.\u00a0 If we all took more time to just do something nice for someone unexpectedly, we would all live in a happier place.\n\n<b>Stay out of the \u201cDrama\u201d:<\/b>\n\nYou know what I am talking about here.\u00a0 Everywhere I have ever worked, there is always a group of employees that sit around and complain and whine about the recent \u201cproblems\u201d .\u00a0 This just creates a negative thought process in everyone.\u00a0 You will be much happier if you purposefully avoid these discussions.\u00a0 You will eliminate that automatic negative thinking.\n\nHave a great week this week from Bridge Careers Travel Agencies!\n\n<em><strong>Every day may not be good, but there&#8217;s something good in every day.\u00a0 ~Author Unknown<\/strong><\/em>\n\n<em><strong>If you don&#8217;t like something change it; if you can&#8217;t change it, change the way you think about it.\u00a0 ~Mary Engelbreit<\/strong><\/em>\n\nArticle by Tulsa staffing expert, Cory Minter, President of Bridge Careers Travel Agencies\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>4 ways to avoid a negative work week Have you ever been stuck in traffic thinking that the traffic jam is never going to let you through?\u00a0 Well, if you live in Tulsa right now, you know exactly what I mean.\u00a0 Our city officials have apparently decided to begin construction on many major intersection in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[120],"tags":[508,509,510,461,470,66,511,512,513,455],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.9 -
