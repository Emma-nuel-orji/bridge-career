did they go?"},"content":{"rendered":"When I was around 13, I remember being presented with situations that really caused me to think about things for the first time.\u00a0 For instance, I remember one time that I happened to see a lady in my home town drop a 5 dollar bill and she did not notice it.\u00a0 I remember the hard decision (at that time):\u00a0 \u201cShould I tell her\u2026\u2026..or pick it up and keep it myself?\u201d\u00a0 Man that was a hard decision at that time in my life.\u00a0 I had not yet developed a foundation of guidelines that defined what I thought was right or wrong.\u00a0 My ethical DNA.\n\nComing from the perspective of a Staffing company, I have been asking myself \u201cWhat has happened to the ethical decisions of many employees in the past decade.\u00a0 I have stories that I just cannot believe almost on a daily basis.\u00a0 Just yesterday, I had an LPN who was hired and accepted the position and she was scheduled to start her job the next day and we got a call from her MOTHER saying that she just was not interested in the position anymore TWO HOURS BEFORE SHE WAS TO START.\u00a0 Now obviously, we wanted to hear that from her lips, however, she never returned any of our calls.\u00a0 Let me remind you, this is from someone who is 40 years old.\n\nI have to stop and ask myself: Where is she coming from that she thought that was the best option?\u00a0 This is not from someone who has a bad work history or anything like that.\u00a0 She is an accomplished nurse with approximately 10 years of experience and 4 years longevity at her last position.\u00a0 How could she conclude after attempting to figure out how to handle this specific situation that the best choice is to call and ask her mother to handle it for her?\u00a0 Furthermore, that it would be best to wait until 2 hours until she is to show up to work to let us know.\n\nEmployees, pay attention!\u00a0 This is why human resource departments within your organization have such strict policies for their employees.\u00a0 It is because for many Americans, they make horrible ethical choices.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why, but they do.\n\nSo, whether you are at home, at work, as a consultant, as a business owner.\u00a0 I think I have a bit of advice that I strongly believe will take you far in your career.\n\n<b>TREAT PEOPLE HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED <\/b>\n\nIsn\u2019t that what we are all really looking for?\u00a0 To find other people to treat us as we would like to be treated.\u00a0 While in a career, this is an often overlooked, but all too important aspect of all aspiring professionals.\u00a0 I\u2019ll bet you the nurse I spoke about earlier would not have appreciated it if she were an office manager and someone else did the same thing to her.\u00a0 The reality is:\u00a0 This person most likely will not be considered for many promotion opportunities due to her unwelcomed and very unpopular way of handling situations.\n\n<b>Have Integrity<\/b>\n\nThe way that you respond to events in your life reflects a lot of about you and your ethical DNA.\u00a0 How you handle situations ultimately reflects your success rate, popularity, how much you make, and most importantly, your credibility.\u00a0 Just do the right thing.\u00a0 Trust me, people in America are starving for people to just do the right thing.\u00a0 If there was a small mistake that you know that you made, but you could easily not own up to it and blame may be placed somewhere else; own up to the mistake.\u00a0 People will admire you for it and increase how much they trust you.\u00a0 It shows great character.\u00a0 At the end of the day, all you have is your character.\n\nGood luck this week.\u00a0 Let\u2019s all show some honesty and integrity.\n\n* <em>Article written by Cory Minter, President of <a href=\"https:\/\/trinityemployment.com\">Bridge Careers Travel Agencies<\/a>, a Tulsa staffing
