I&#8217;m president of Bridge Careers Travel Agencies. Bridge Career is a staffing company, we staff primarily in the medical field, we staff for everything from a front office person, medical billing, X-ray techs, medical assistance, LPNs, RNs, everything that you can think of in the medical field, all the way up to a physician\u2019s assistant. That&#8217;s what we provide staffing for. We do that not only in medical clinics but also in the hospitals.\n\nThen we have another division and we focus on staffing for banking, finance and accounting, and we&#8217;ve been doing this of a little over 10 years now. This last month, we were acknowledged as one of the 5,000 fastest growing companies in the US by <em>Inc. Magazine<\/em> and featured in one of their magazines, which we&#8217;re really proud of. In the last three years, we&#8217;ve been one of Tulsa&#8217;s fastest growing companies. The way that we&#8217;ve done that is doing a quality job for the people that we work with and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re really proud of, and something that we take very seriously.\n\nI was wanting to tell you just real quickly for this video, somebody came up to me the other day and they had made the comment, they said &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re only as good as the people that you&#8217;re around. You&#8217;re only about the average of the people you&#8217;re around.&#8221; I got to thinking about this, especially because the person that was with me and heard them say that, he was somebody that I&#8217;m of mentoring. He asked me, &#8220;Well, how do I get around the people that I would want to be around?&#8221;\n\nBecause this young man is trying to take his life to a different level and he&#8217;s going to take his career to a different level, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, how in the world do I get around these people?&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Hey, why not just talk about how that worked for me and share that, and see if this helps somebody with your process if you&#8217;re trying to do the same thing.&#8221;\n\nThe first thing I told this guy was, &#8220;Take an inventory of who you&#8217;re around and make sure that you&#8217;re not the one pulling them up all the time.&#8221; In this case I think that this guy, that was his situation. He&#8217;s always the one pulling people he&#8217;s around up but it&#8217;s mainly because he is &#8212; at one point in time, the people that he was around, they were at the same level, but he has continued to grow whereas they stayed the same place. If you&#8217;re going to grow in your career and become successful, I can almost guarantee you that you&#8217;re going to experience something like this.\n\nYou&#8217;re going to start noticing a difference in between your core friends and where you&#8217;re going. It doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re bad it just means that you&#8217;re going in different directions. At some point, you may have to start to separate a little bit. You need to take an inventory of who you&#8217;re around and if you&#8217;re not around people that are pulling you up, well then you might want to consider if you&#8217;re around the right people and then start making some changes. How would you do that if you&#8217;re going to have &#8212; if you\u2019re wanting to make some changes to the people you&#8217;re around?\n\nI want to talk to you about my process with it. The first thing is, is you want to decide who it is that you want to be around. If you&#8217;re wanting to move to another level, go look at the people that are already there that you see and take note, and figure out a way to get around those individuals. But I want you to know; it&#8217;s not going to happen overnight and it&#8217;s not going to happen with just one conversation. It happens over a period of time.\n\nWhat I did in this situation is I notice the people I wanted to be around, and so I found events and different things that I knew that they would be at and I just showed up. I&#8217;ll tell you what, I felt like a lonely little fly in the room whenever I started doing that, I did. I didn&#8217;t know anyone and I just felt about that small, that&#8217;s how I felt. But I kept going and over time people would start to see who I &#8212; acknowledge me and say, &#8220;Hi&#8221; and it helped me to open up new conversation. When I started opening up new conversation, that&#8217;s how it starts to happen. Make sure that you&#8217;re around at the same events that they go to.\n\nNow I&#8217;m invited to stuff I can&#8217;t even believe I&#8217;m invited to. I got invited last night to some private screening of a Mel Gibson film and I don&#8217;t even know how the guy got a hold of me. I asked him and he said, &#8220;Well, I just noticed that you&#8217;re one of the leaders in Tulsa&#8221; so he sent me a thing. Slowly you&#8217;re going to start getting invited to places that you would never think that you would ever be going to, much less, be asked to go to it. The next thing is, be intentional to the events and make sure you go, I&#8217;m sorry that&#8217;s the same one.\n\nThe next thing is, when you talk to these individuals, ask them about themselves and don&#8217;t talk about you. Big mistake I made. It&#8217;s really silly but I\u2019ll tell you what, any novice sales person or anyone novice in a networking type of an event, let me tell you how to spot them so easy, so easy, all they do is talk about themselves. Everybody at the table is sitting around watching this person talk about themselves and they rarely ask any questions, they don&#8217;t give people the opportunity to have a conversation. They just keep trucking along and talking about themselves.\n\nIf you notice someone doing this, take note and start paying attention so that you don&#8217;t go and do the exact same thing yourself. If you are a talker, which I have been when I grew up and a lot of the top sales people are around, they have the gift of gab. But they misuse it in a way where they think that what gets them where they want to go is talking about themselves, and it&#8217;s not that at all. Let me tell you what it is, you ask the person that you want to be around, you ask them about themselves and give them the opportunity to talk about themselves.\n\nI&#8217;m telling you, I know it sounds crazy to some of you, but that is the way. Let me tell you why, the reason is because no one enjoys listening to anyone else more than they do themselves. It is the truth. It&#8217;s just that in our culture, we don&#8217;t want to just sit around and listen to other people. If you&#8217;re talking to people of importance they are used to listening to everybody else talk and being cordial to them. They are not used to being asked questions about their success, how they got there, what are the things that they do, what are their hobbies, what are the things that they most enjoy doing.\n\nThey never have anyone, they never have an audience that just wants to listen to those things. They love to talk about themselves but everybody does. If you get asked a question about yourself, it&#8217;s a pride thing, you feel great that they&#8217;re interested enough in you to ask you. What you want to do, is whoever you want to be around, give them the best gift they&#8217;ve had all day, give them the gift of being able to talk about themselves. They will love you for it and you will become different than everybody else. Because everybody else wanted to have a conversation that either benefited them or gave them the opportunity to talk about themselves. I promise you that one little thing, it will help you a lot.\n\nThe last thing is once you make a connection, before you try to ask them to go to lunch or anything like that, make a connection with them and it&#8217;s going to happen generally by doing exactly what I just said, that&#8217;s asking them about themselves. Once you feel like there is a connection, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;d love to go and have lunch with you some time.&#8221; Generally if you are the type of person who gave them an opportunity to talk about themselves, they&#8217;ll oblige you to that.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nBut if you do have an opportunity to have lunch with someone that is at a level that you are not yet at and you want to be where they&#8217;re at, well then, when you do have lunch, give them another set of opportunities to talk about themselves. But listen to me, have questions prepared that will give you insight to how they got where they are at and just let them train you how to get there.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nIf you&#8217;ll ask them questions like, &#8220;What was one of the most important things you did in your career that helped you to get where you&#8217;re at? What are two or three of the most influential books that you&#8217;ve read that helped you to get where you are at and why did you like that book so much?\u201d\n\nTell them a little bit about your business. I always like to ask this, especially people way higher than me, I always ask them, &#8220;Listen, this is what I do, tell me what should I be concerned about my business?&#8221; I love asking that question. It gives them insight. I ask them questions like, &#8220;What is it that you are learning right now that&#8217;s helping you the most?&#8221;\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nYou can go on online on Google or whatever it is that you go and ask them, and ask Google, \u201cWhat are the great questions to ask a mentor?\u201d But be intentional with your time especially, at first. Trust me, you will impress them by almost not saying a word other than asking questions and shutting up, and listening. Most people lack the ability to shut up and listen intently.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nIf you can do that, you\u2019re going to be probably in the top 10% of people that other people want to be around. Not only that, you are going to learn. The thing is, is if you are the only one talking, you are the only one not learning. Give yourself the opportunity to learn, it\u2019s going to make a big, big difference.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nListen I told you about Bridge Career earlier on in this video.
