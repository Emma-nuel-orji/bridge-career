I am president of Bridge Careers Travel Agencies, a Tulsa staffing company and I want to talk to you a little bit today about job searching strategies. I want to tell you a quick little story. I went to a, it was a networking function and I&#8217;d met somebody the other day that had literally been, they had been working for over twenty years and have never had to search for a job. They had been in like two or three jobs in the twenty year time period but they literally had never had to look for job because they just they were always recruited. All of a sudden, partly because of our economy, they had to lay off and they&#8217;re left looking for a job. Oh, my goodness, what is it that I do? They were trying to figure out job search strategies but think about this, they hadn&#8217;t been in the job search world for twenty years. Things have changed a whole lot in 20 years.\n\nI&#8217;d given her a piece of advice and I think this might help some of our, some of the people that might be looking for a job right now that have never had to look for a job for a while. Let&#8217;s take a look at these three things that I think will really help you, it&#8217;s going to help somebody that hasn&#8217;t done this in a good while. First thing is to target your resume. Most people will put out a resume that is just general, it has general terms on it, it&#8217;s meant to be sent for every job so they have one resume, they send it out to hundreds of different job opportunities and there&#8217;s like hoping that it&#8217;ll work. It really helps a whole lot, if you will take time to cater your resume to that job. If you have the opportunity of seeing some kind of job description of any sorts, it would really help to go and take a introspective look at your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorebball.com\">skill<\/a> set and look around that job description.\n\nIf there&#8217;s something on in your skills set that&#8217;s on that job description, but you don&#8217;t have it on your resume, figure out a way to get it on there. Go up to the top of your resume and specifically tailor your resume to that job. Let the reader know I am looking to apply for this job, that way you don&#8217;t get put in some other category, where they don&#8217;t know what to do with you. You got to be very clear and specific and concise on what it is that you&#8217;re applying for. I just want people to take their skill set that they have and make sure that they cater their resume to fit the exact job. It&#8217;s going to help you to get noticed by a lot more employees, employers, I promise you.\n\nThe second thing that I want to encourage someone to do is to network. When you are unemployed, it is probably one of the most difficult things or one of the things that most people just don&#8217;t want to go do is go out and network because they feel like, &#8220;I&#8217;m unemployed, I don&#8217;t have a really, you know, I don&#8217;t have a solid position to tell people am in right now,&#8221; and it&#8217;s an insecure moment, it&#8217;s a fearful moment in most people&#8217;s lives. It is those individuals that have confidence to overcome that fear and get out and network and confidently be able to go out and tell people what they know how to do, that always are able to get a position or get noticed or get interviewed or somebody tells them about an opportunity. You need to be able to get out enough so that you can let people know what you&#8217;re looking for.\u00a0other people will help you. It is a great compliment just to ask somebody for their help. If you can confidently tell someone that you&#8217;re out of a job and you&#8217;re looking for this, you&#8217;re a professional in this industry and that&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;re looking for and you present yourself as someone who is going somewhere and just can&#8217;t wait to find the next opportunity, rather than, &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m out of a job. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221; Having that different kind of take on yourself and presentation about yourself is really going to help you out. Getting in front of as many people as you can, other people will help you and that is how 90 percent of the best jobs are found by individuals. Don&#8217;t ever forget networking just because you&#8217;re out of a job.\n\nAre you looking for the top Tulsa staffing company?\n\nThird thing that I want to encourage people to do is to watch your social media. If you&#8217;ve been out of the job searching world for a good while or even just really in the past like five or ten years, social media is a very easy way for employers to just do a quick little search and learn a whole lot about you. You want to pay really close attention to what you have presented about yourself on social media. Make sure that it is professional. Make sure that there&#8217;s nothing out there that&#8217;s going to raise big red flags to your employer. Here&#8217;s a great example, it&#8217;s probably not a good idea for you to have twenty pictures of you going out and partying and obviously being drunk over and over again on your social media. If someone were to go and look at that, it may paint a really bad picture and I know of many, many employers that do, they go and look on social media and make sure that someone fits what they&#8217;re looking for, there aren&#8217;t any red flags.\n\nHere&#8217;s another thing, if you are going out and networking like what I was talking about before, and you ask someone to please go out and, &#8220;I&#8217;d be interested in this job opportunity,&#8221; and they&#8217;re thinking about presenting you to their boss or their friend or whoever it is, there&#8217;s a decent chance they&#8217;re going to go and look you up on social media as well. You want to give any friends or networking contact, you don&#8217;t want to give them a reason why not to refer you. They are going to know that there&#8217;s a good chance that this company or person deserves recommending to, may go out and do a social media search on you and see what they see. You don&#8217;t want to give them a reason to say, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m a little bit concerned in recommending this person,&#8221; all because of what they&#8217;re seeing on Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter or whatever type of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thrive15.com\">social media marketing<\/a> feed that you post to. Be real careful with that.\n\nIf you pay attention to these three things, I promise you it&#8217;s going to increase your way of doing your job search, it&#8217;s going to increase your results and I wish you the very best of luck in finding a job.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.makeyourlifeepic.com\">Tulsa<\/a> staffing company","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Cory Minter.
