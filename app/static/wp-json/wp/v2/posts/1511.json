Your Application Seriously"},"content":{"rendered":"<em>Article written by Tulsa staffing expert, Cory Minter, with Bridge Careers Travel Agencies<\/em>\n\n<b>Take your application seriously:<\/b>\n\nYou would be surprised how many people just simply do not take the application seriously.\u00a0 There are so many things that you can tell by the way that one goes about filling out an application.\u00a0 The funny thing is that usually it is the receptionist that watches and reviews the applications within most offices and in our office, their opinion is heavily weighted and if someone does not pay attention to some of the details, we are told firmly about it and it really makes an impression on all of us in the office.\u00a0 So I have 3 main details for you to consider when filling out an employment application at any company.\n\n<b>Do pay attention to the details:<\/b>\n\nIt is hard for some to consider and to take into consideration that the receptionist at any company most likely knows that application like the back of their hand.\u00a0 Also, it is most likely a pet peeve of theirs when the same things are looked over and missed time after time.\u00a0 The reality is that there are approximately 100 to 200 small sections on the average job application and it is very easy for the average person to miss at least one of these blanks.\u00a0 Remember that it is the receptionist\u2019s job to look over the application and notice any blanks that are unfilled and make sure that it is fully completed.\u00a0 If you miss too many of these sections, it may become blatantly obvious that you do not pay attention to detail.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t let this silly mistake happen to you.\n\n<b>Do not write \u201cPlease See Resume\u201d:<\/b>\n\nEach application that you fill out is considered a legal document that you fill out with the respective corporation.\u00a0 The application is meant to have language in it that states that you promise that all of the positions listed on the application are \u201creal positions\u201d and to verify that there is no falsifying on the application.\u00a0 If you do not list anything on the application, the document is basically voided.\u00a0 In fact, I would warn you not to work for a company that does not make you fully fill out a formal application.\u00a0 It is an essential part of the hiring process.\u00a0 In addition as listed above, you will most likely really frustrate the receptionist which will in turn be glad to notify the rest of the staff with their concerns.\n\n<b>Write Clearly:<\/b>\n\nIn our company, we need to refer back to the application to get certain answers answered and it is so frustrating to just simply not be able to read it.\u00a0 Also, again, when the receptionist is accepting your chicken scratched application, there will most likely be some assumptions made that very well may be passed onto the interviewer.\u00a0 In addition, this is a pretty obvious thing to pay attention to.\u00a0\u00a0But, being in the business of accepting many applications, you would not believe some of the examples that I have seen that honestly kept me from pursuing them further.\n\nI am writing this section because I just am surprised at what some \u201cProfessionals\u201d do to represent themselves.\u00a0 In my mind, this is a topic that is just too simple and elementary to be even addressing.\u00a0 Especially with some of the candidates that are applying for very \u201cprofessional positions\u201d.\u00a0 However, the fact that I am writing this piece right now should say something about the way that many have treated the basic application document within our organization.\u00a0 I honestly wish the best for anyone that is unemployed at the moment in this kind of economy.\u00a0 I hope that this short piece helps someone to think about the attention that they put into the simple Job Application.\u00a0 And that more professionals will take their application seriously.\n\nGood Luck!","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Article written by Tulsa staffing expert, Cory Minter, with Bridge Careers Travel Agencies Take your application seriously: You
