My name is Cory Minter. I&#8217;m president at Bridge Careers Travel Agencies. Bridge Career is a staffing company. We specialize in staffing in the medical field where we staff anything from a front office personnel all the way to a physician&#8217;s assistant, just everything in between there. We staff for both medical clinics and hospitals in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City area.\n\nThen, our next division is we staff primarily in accounting, banking and finance. We&#8217;ve done this over the last 10 years and the reason that we&#8217;ve been successful is this. We focus on hiring only A-players and we ask our partners not to tolerate B and C level players from us. If they will commit to terminating the people that are not A-players, slowly they will begin to build and develop a team of only A-players. That&#8217;s what it is that we do.\n\nTrinity, we put quality over quantity. When we do that, quantity will come, but that&#8217;s the whole success plan of our business. That&#8217;s how we do what we do. We build our business by slowly, organically, meeting with different people in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. We meet with them at all these different events that we go to. I try to make sure and be around the type of people that make decisions and that sort of thing. But one thing that I noticed, that was at one of the events that we were at, it&#8217;s the same event, it happens at every event I go to, but it really just clicked with me at one that I was at last week. It was kind of networking event, it was an event for the business side of things, it was more in the accounting and banking industries.\n\nEvery one of these guys in this meeting, they were all at high levels. I mean, I look up to almost every one of them, but this is the difference. All I can see on most of their faces is almost anxiety and angst to try to&#8211; They&#8217;re all nervous and their trying to figure out who they need to talk to for the next deal. I&#8217;m not talking about everyone, but if you take a survey of the room, you can definitely tell that a majority of the people there are, one, really wanting to be liked, wanting to be noticed. They&#8217;re a little bit uncomfortable in their own skin.\n\nIt reminds me of myself, especially when I was starting business. It&#8217;s not as much now, but it happens occasionally, where you just get into a place where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I belong here.&#8221; You do belong there, but in the moment, you just don&#8217;t feel like it. It&#8217;s just so interesting.\n\nI&#8217;m going to explain to you a little bit better because I&#8217;m not communicating it very well. But I&#8217;m just telling you, when you see a room like that, everyone is wanting to be liked, they&#8217;re wanting to be accepted to some extent. There are many of them, they&#8217;re just trying to figure out where their next business deal is going to come from. Some of you can notice when you get into conversations with them, the only things that they ask you about and it&#8217;s directed to &#8220;How can you help me get where I want to go?&#8221; I just really don&#8217;t think that is a way of making long term success. I just see so much stress on so many people that I&#8217;m around. Even the people that are at such high level.\n\nI&#8217;m going to share a few things that I&#8217;ve learned that I believe will help to ease your stress level. Because I got to think that I&#8217;m not the only one dealing with it and these people that are at high levels, they&#8217;re not the only ones dealing with it. I think that there might be somebody that could possibly be listening to this that deals with it as well. These are like four things. I have one more and I just can&#8217;t remember it at the moment. Maybe I&#8217;ll remember it during the middle of this video. But there are four things that really make big difference. I&#8217;m going to explain to you what it is.\n\nThe first one is, no matter what you do, commit to being the very best that you can be. That&#8217;s it. Let me explain that just a little bit. When you go to work, and you do your very best and you know it, you don&#8217;t slouch off. Everybody does this, slouch off, sometimes they might click on the internet, do something that they would prefer to do, whatever it is. If you will commit to not doing that, when you go home at night you&#8217;re going to know that you did the very best that you could do. It&#8217;s going to help you get some sleep at night.\n\nSomeone that mentored me, he had shared this story with me, he said, &#8220;You know, the thing that I do, especially during stressful situations&#8211;&#8221; because this particular person bought a bank, and the bank closed the day of the recession. That&#8217;s what happened to him. He was talking about how he got through this. Now, the guy is flourishing, doing really great. But this is what he said, during that time, one of his mentors told him to look in the mirror before you go to work and say to yourself, &#8220;Listen, I&#8217;m going to do the very best that I can today.&#8221; Then, when you get home, you look in the mirror and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;You know, I did the very best that I can today.&#8221; And so shut it off and be with your family and make sure you have a little bit of a balanced life. I see a lot of people that are at high levels, that they don&#8217;t know how to turn that off. You can kind of see the stress level in them and it makes me sad.\n\nThe second thing is, be grateful for what you&#8217;ve been given. There is something about being grateful that leads to happiness. It gives you contentment. It brings peace. All of those things combined together, I swear to you, it comes with being grateful. I&#8217;ll tell you this, that being grateful is not natural. I&#8217;ve got a four year old and when I go and prepare a nice meal for him, something to keep him alive, and I go give it to him, and he throws a fit about it. I&#8217;m telling you, that as human beings we&#8217;re not naturally grateful, you have to work at it.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nThis is something that I&#8217;ve put into practice that has worked really well. It&#8217;s just simply this. The first two minutes, I&#8217;m not asking for a lot of time, the first two minutes of every day just wake up and start thinking about things that you are grateful for. Depending on where you&#8217;re at in life, your struggle, all of that stuff, it might be harder or easier depending on where you&#8217;re at. But if you will spend this time being grateful, it&#8217;s going to change your perspective throughout the day. Sometimes you need to step back and just be grateful for the fact that when you walk over and you turn on the kitchen sink, water comes out. Because there&#8217;s a big chunk of the world, who cannot even fathom that luxury.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nBut we have to start looking at being grateful for we have a place to live. We have a roof over our heads. For some people, you have a car, that you have transportation. That you have people that are around you that love you. You got to look at all of the small things that we take for granted every day that we should be grateful for. If anything else, if you live inside of the United States of America, you should be unbelievably grateful for the fact that we live in a free nation. If you can start putting your focus on the things that you are grateful for, your perspective about the things that happen that don&#8217;t go your way throughout the day, takes a smaller and smaller cut into your flesh whenever you become stressed. It makes you less stressful. I promise you, be grateful and it&#8217;s going to change your ballgame.\n\nThe third thing is, when you&#8217;re around other people, put other people&#8217;s interest in front of yourself. Take interest in the person that you are around. Really be interested in them and look for ways, at least just one time a day, look for ways to be able to help someone get whatever they want. Zig Ziglar said this, but he said he didn&#8217;t even say. He heard it from someone else. But if you help enough people go get what they want, you are not going to believe what is going to come your way. You just look for different opportunities, where you can try to help somebody in their pursuit to whatever it is that they&#8217;re trying to go after. I promise you, it&#8217;s going to change the entire ballgame at how they look at you. You&#8217;ll have favor with people who make big decisions and who might recommend you and you&#8217;re not asking for recommendation, you are just trying to help them get what they want.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nThe last thing is this, I got to wrap it up really quick, and that is whatever it is that you&#8217;re going through, believe the best is yet to come. Having that top of viewpoint changes your perspective, also, in the way that you want to be. Because it gives you hope, you need to always have hope at whatever you&#8217;re going after. If you&#8217;re going after a huge mountain type go or if you&#8217;re going after small little hill. Everyone needs to have hope, but hope starts with believing the best is yet to come.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nThese are some things that I think help people in their perspective, it helps people when I notice anxiety. I just don&#8217;t think the people that are dealing with things that I deal all the time have these four or five things in their mind throughout the day. When you&#8217;re intentional with what you think about, you&#8217;re going to start changing the way your imagination works and then your perspective.\u00a0Tulsa Staffing\n\nI hope that this helps someone today with just pick-me-up for a Thursday today.
